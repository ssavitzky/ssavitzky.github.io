<p> If you develop software and haven't just returned from the moon, you've
    undoubtedly heard that <a
    href="https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/" >GitHub</a> is
    being acquired by <a href=
    "https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/"
    >Microsoft</a>.  Depending on your affiliations you might be spelling
    "being acquired by" as "selling out to".  The rest of you are probably
    wondering what on Earth a GitHub is, and why Microsoft would want one.
    Let me explain.

<p> Please note:  this post isn't about my opinion of today's news.  It's
    really too early to tell, though I may get into that a little toward the
    end.  Instead, I'm going to explain what GitHub is, and why it matters.
    But first I have to explain <a href="https://git-scm.com/" >Git</a>.

<p> Git is a version-control system.  (Version-control systems are sometimes
    called "source code management" (SCM) systems.  If you look closely you
    might even have spotted "scm" in git's URL up there at the end of the last
    paragraph.)  Basically, a version-control system lets you record the
    complete history of a project, with what changes were made, who made the
    each change, when they changed it, and their notes about what they did and
    why.  It doesn't have to be a software project, either.  It can be
    recipes, photographs, books, the papers you're writing for school, or even
    blog entries.  (Yes, I do.)

<p> Before git, most version-control systems kept track of changes in text
    files (which of course is what all source code is) by recording which
    lines are different from the previous version.  (It's usually done by a
    program called <code>diff</code>.)  This was very compact, but it could
    also be very slow if you had to undo all the changes between two versions
    in order to see what the older one looked like.

<p> Git, on the other hand, is blindingly fast in part because it works in the
    stupidest way possible (which is <em>why</em> it's called "git").  It
    simply takes the new version of each file that changed since the last
    version, zips it up, and stuffs it whole into its repository.  So it takes
    git about the same amount of time to roll a file back two versions or two
    hundred.

<p> The other thing that makes git fast is where it <em>keeps</em> all of its
    version information.  Before git, most version-control systems used a
    centralized repository on a server somewhere.  (Subversion, one of the
    best of these, even lets you browse the repository with a web browser.)
    That means that all the change information is going over a network.  Git
    keeps its repository (these days everyone shortens that to "repo") on your
    local disk, right next to your working copy, in a hidden subdirectory
    called "<code>.git</code>".

<p> Because its repo is local, and contains the entire history of your
    project, you don't need a network connection to use git.  On the beach, in
    an airplane, on a boat, <del>with a goat</del>, it doesn't matter to git.
    It's <em>de</em>-centralized.  It gets a little more complicated when more
    than one developer is working on a project.

<p> Bob's been in the office all week working on a project.  When his boss,
    Alice, comes back from the open source conference she's been at all week,
    all she has to do is tell git to fetch all the changes that Bob made while
    she was away.  Git gets them directly from Bob's repo.  If Alice didn't
    make any changes, that's called a "fast-forward" merge -- git just takes
    the changes that Bob made, copies those files into Alice's repo, updates
    her working tree, and it's done.

<p> It's a little trickier if Alice had time to make some changes, too.  Now
    Alice has to merge the two sets of changes, and then let Bob pull the
    merged files onto <em>his</em> computer.  By the way, a "pull" is just a
    fetch followed by a merge, but it's so common that git has a shorthand way
    of doing it. (I'm oversimplifying here, but this isn't the time to go into
    the difference between merge and rebase.  It's also not a good time to
    talk about branches -- maybe some other week.)  As you can imagine, this
    gets out of hand pretty quickly, and it's even worse if there's a whole
    team working on the project.

<p> The obvious thing to do is for the group to have one repo on a server
    somewhere that has what everyone agrees is the definitive set of files on
    it.  Bob pushes his changes to the server, and when Alice tries to push
    <em>her</em> changes, git balks and gives her an error message.  Now it's
    Alice's responsibility to make any necessary fixes and push them to the
    server.  Actually, in a real team, Alice would send her proposed changes
    around by making a diff and sending email to the other team members to
    review, and not actually push her changes until someone approves them.

<p> In a large team, this is kind of a hub-and-spokes arrangement.  You can
    see where this is going, right? 

<p> <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a company that provides a place
    for people and projects to put shared git repositories where other people
    can see them, clone them, and contribute to them.  GitHub has become
    wildly popular, because it's a great place to share software.  If you have
    an open-source software project, putting a public repo on GitHub is the
    most effective way to reach developers.  It's so popular that Google and
    Microsoft shut down their own code-hosting sites (Google Code and CodePlex
    respectively) and moved to GitHub.  Microsoft, it turns out, is GitHub's
    biggest contributor.

<p> Putting a public repository on GitHub is free.  If you want to set up
    <em>private</em> repositories, GitHub will charge you for it, and if your
    company wants to put a clone of GitHub on its own private servers they can
    buy GitHub Enterprise, but if your software is free, so's your space on
    GitHub.

<p> That's a bit of a problem, because the software that runs GitHub is
    <em>not</em> free.  That means that they need a steady stream of income to
    pay their in-house developers, because they're not going to get any help
    from the open-source developer community.  GitHub lost $66 million in
    2016, and doesn't really have a sustainable business model that would make
    them attractive to investors.  They needed to get acquired, or they had a
    real risk of going under.  And when a service based on proprietary
    software goes under, all of their customers have a big problem.  But their
    users?  Heh.

<p> Everybody knows the old adage, "if you're getting a service for free
    you're not the customer, you're the product."  That's especially true for
    companies like Google and Facebook, which sell their users' eyeballs to
    advertisers.  It's a lot less true for a company whose users can leave any
    time they want, painlessly, taking all their data <em>and their
    readers</em> with them.  I'm sure most of my readers here on Dreamwidth
    remember what happened to Livejournal when they got bought by the
    Russians.  Well, GitHub is being bought by Microsoft.  It's not entirely
    clear which is worse.

<p> GitHub has an even worse problem than Livejournal did, because
    "cross-posting" is basically the way git <em>works.</em> There's a company
    called <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a> that looks a lot like
    GitHub, except that their core software -- the stuff that wraps a slick
    web interface around a git repository -- is open source.  (They do sell
    extensions, but most projects aren't going to need them.)  If you want to
    set up your own private GitLab site, it's free, and you can do it in ten
    minutes with a one-line command.  If you find bugs, you can fix them
    yourself.  You'll find a couple of great quotes from their blog at the end
    of the notes, but the bottom line is that 100,000 repositories have moved
    from GitHub to GitLab <em>in the last 24 hours.</em>

<p> And once you've moved a project to GitLab, you don't have to worry about
    what happens to it, because the open-source core of it will continue to be
    maintained by its community.  That's what happened when a company called
    Netscape went belly-up:  Mozilla Firefox is still around and doing fine.
    And if the fact that GitLab is for profit is a problem for you, there's
    Apache Allura, gitolite3, gitbucket, and gitweb (to name a few).  Go for
    it!

<p> This <em>so</em> wasn't what I was planning to write today.

    " While we admire what's been done, our strategy differs in two key areas. First,
      instead of integrating multiple tools together, we believe a single application,
      built from the ground up to support the entire DevOps lifecycle is a better
      experience leading to a faster cycle time. Second, it’s important to us that the
      core of our product always remain open source itself as well. "

    " It has been a crazy 24 hours for GitLab. More than 2,000 people tweeted about
      #movingtogitlab. We imported over 100,000 repositories, and we've seen a 7x increase
      in orders. We went live on Bloomberg TV. And on top of that, Apple announced an
      Xcode integration with GitLab. "
