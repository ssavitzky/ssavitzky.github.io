<a title="Don Marti www/google-chrome.html" href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/blosxom/www/google-chrome.html">Don Marti www/google-chrome.html</a> <blockquote>The idea of tabs being first class citizens makes a lot of sense, but why have a sub-window-manager that just manages browser windows in tabs, when you could have a tabbed window manager that can manage everything? I might want a browser and a spreadsheet to share a tab.

So the right "browser" for a Linux environment might just be a really fast HTML/JavaScript viewer that talks to a separate HTTP client/cache, a Google Gears server, and a preferences/history server -- all of which are also available to the rest of the desktop. The browser isn't necessarily the only thing that wants to speak HTTP, use Gears, or store preferences. And the "browser" application could fit into a tabbed window or a standalone window, just as the window manager would let you do for anything else on the desktop.</blockquote> I'm in complete agreement.  I already <em>have</em> a tabbed window manager (the venerable CTWM).  I want very much to have all the browsers operating out of my home directory, which is shared among half-a-dozen machines using NFS, to share the same <em>flat file</em> preference file, bookmarks, and history.  I wouldn't mind throwing my shell and emacs windows into that mix as well.  I already have a text box with command history and completion -- it's called <code>xterm</code>.
