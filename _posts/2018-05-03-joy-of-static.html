<p> Recently I read a couple of blog posts that set me thinking in some
    interesting directions.  Like most of the things I find on LinkedIn, they
    were mostly a little annoying, with a few good points.  For example,
    <cite><a href="https://cms2cms.com/blog/decisively-reject-using-wix/" >Why
    You Should Decisively Reject Using Wix</a></cite> gives a lot of good
    reasons not to use Wix, which is a free website builder and host that lets
    you throw together a website in half an hour by simply picking a
    template and dragging and dropping things into it.  What's not to like,
    right?  Well,...

<ol>
  <li> You don't own it.  It's on their site.  It has <em>their</em> ads on
       it.  Say what you like about ad-supported websites, it isn't
       <em>your</em> website they're supporting..  It's free, so you're the
       product, not the customer.
  <li> But wait!  You can pay them to take the ads off!  But it's not cheap:
       plans go from $4-$24 per month.  For that you can get a plan from, say,
       <a href="https://www.hawkhost.com/">Hawkhost.com</a>, that will give
       you full control over your site and its content, and a choice of
       hundreds of different content management systems that you can switch
       between any time you want.
  <li> You don't have many choices in how your site looks.  Sure they have 500
       site templates.  But once you pick one, you're stuck with it.  And they
       have <em>millions</em> of users.  Your site is going to look like at
       least a couple of thousand others.
</ol>

<p> The site that post is on, <a
    href="https://cms2cms.com/blog/decisively-reject-using-wix/">CMS2CMS</a>,
    is in the business of helping you migrate a website from one Content
    Management System -- CMS -- to another.  They'll help you get off of Wix,
    for example, and onto Wordpress or Joomla or...  Interesting thing is,
    they won't just give you plain old HTML and build your site from scratch.
    They'll happily get you <em>off</em> of a plain HTML site and onto a CMS.
    They have this to say about HTML:

<blockquote>
<p> To create a static website may not cost you a thing but to maintain such
    site can be very expensive. You will have to hire programmers each time
    you want to perform some changes to your web project.

<p> It is possible to develop and add any kind of functionality to your
    website. It is a well-known fact that you have stricter control over the
    file structure, design, and SEO.	Although it is possible to customise
    your web project to fit your needs, there is the necessity to have deep
    coding knowledge. But even then there is the risk to make a mistake and to
    damage the code.

<p> A static site is lighter than a website built on CMS and this makes it
    faster.  Various plugins or extensions are not available for a static
    HTML site. In case you want some, then you will have to code every piece
    of functionality.

<p> If the website is not very big, it is easier to make some changes,
    modifications and to customise it according to your needs.	It is possible
    to design each page of HTML site in a different way with the available
    templates. But it will be your job to code in and around the template for
    each page. 
</blockquote>

<p> Rubbish.

<p> Let's look at their main points:

<p> <em>You will have to hire programmers each time you want to perform some
    changes to your web project.</em> Huh?  With HTML your content is <em>just
    text</em>.  Nobody programs a web server from the ground up these days.
    (I've done it -- it's fun.)  On a shared-hosting site like HawkHost, it's
    <em>already there.</em>  All you have to do is tell them your site's
    name.  

<p> Your site is just text.  HTML and CSS stand for HyperText Markup Language
    and Cascading Style Sheets, respectively.  They are <em>not</em>
    programming languages, they're <em>markup</em>.  HTML tags say what parts
    of a page <em>mean</em> -- a headline, a paragraph, a link, an emphasized
    word, and so on.  You can print the basic cheat-sheet on a bookmark.
    There are some more specialized tags, like the ones for images, tables,
    and audio players.  But they're all simple.

<p> <em>[I]t will be your job to code in and around the template for each
    page. </em> No, if you're writing in HTML, the "code" is already there.
    CSS is a description of what each part is supposed to <em>look like</em>:
    a headline in bold sans-serif, a paragraph in Times Roman, a link red when
    before you click on it and blue afterwards, emphasized text in italics or
    boldface.  You can print <em>that</em> cheat-sheet on the other side of
    the bookmark.  

<p> Yes, there's more advanced CSS, too, and you can do strange and wonderful
    things with it.  (Take a look at the <a
    href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" >CSS Zen Garden</a>, for example.)
    You can get one of thousands of the available CSS stylesheets, tweak it
    with your favorite fonts and layouts, and add it to your site.
    Complicated multi-column layouts that change to look great on everything
    from a phone to a wide screen?  Easy -- go to <a
    href="https://purecss.io/" >Pure CSS</a>, add one line to your basic page
    template and a few words to some of your tags, and you've got it.

<p> You don't even have to write HTML or CSS if you don't want to -- you can
    write plain text in any of a variety of markup languages -- <a
    href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" >Markdown</a> is the
    most popular at the moment -- and have it translated automatically to
    HTML.  There are also dozens of <em>static site generators</em> that do it
    for you.

<p> <em>Various plugins or extensions are not available for a static
    HTML site. In case you want some, then you will have to code every piece
    of functionality.</em> As a matter of fact, people have <em>already
    done</em> that coding, and it's available for free in nearly infinite
    variety on sites like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.  And see
    "static site generators" above.  They all have plugins and themes, and
    templates.  Change one template, re-build your site with one command, and
    deploy it.

<p> You may be wondering where Javascript fits in.  That <em>is</em> a
    programming language, but it runs <em>on the reader's browser.</em>  There
    are thousands of available libraries and pre-built Javascript applications
    -- plugins, effectively -- that you can add to your site to liven it up
    with animation and other special effects.  About the only thing that you
    can't do with a completely static site is add interactive features like
    comments and user logins, and there are ways around that.  

<p> But the best thing about static sites is the way you work on them, because
    you do that <em>on your own computer.</em> Almost every CMS keeps your
    site content in a database on the server, and I have another whole rant
    about that.  A static site lives on your laptop; you can work on it
    without having to have an internet connection, and deploy it only when
    you have one and you're happy with the way it looks.

<p> Not only can you use your favorite text editor (and there are some
    <em>awesome</em> ones out there -- take a look at <a
    href="https://atom.io/" >Atom</a> for example), but because you have a
    complete copy of your site on your computer <em>and</em> on your web host,
    they effectively back each other up.  And because you can use <a
    href="https://git-scm.com/doc" >git</a> for version control, you not only
    have backups but a complete history of every change you make to your site.

<p> The next few posts in this series (did I mention that this is a series?) will
    go into how to write HTML in more detail, including the tiny bit of CSS
    magic that lets you embed poetry in <em>any</em> page including a DW post,
    and teach you the basics of git.
