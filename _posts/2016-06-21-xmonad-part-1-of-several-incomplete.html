<p> As I mentioned about a week ago, I've been trying to write more.  And
    since my current obsession is a program called <a
    href="http://xmonad.org/documentation.html" >xmonad</a>, well, ...
</p>
<p> This is incomplete: it's about the first day's worth (I've been trying to
    write about 500 words per day).  Comments and suggestions are, of course,
    welcome. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> My new 27" monitors arrived at work; I took advantage of the change to
    rearrange my work space.  Before, it was the set-up I've had for most of
    the last three years -- monitor in front on a stand, second monitor on the
    right, and my laptop on the left.  The new laptop, however, has a decent
    keyboard (with trackpoint and three buttons), and the monitors between
    them occupy about 2/3 of the desk.
</p>
<p> The new arrangement has the laptop dock under the "middle" monitor; the
    laptop, being a business-class Dell, has both a pointing stick and a
    middle "mouse" button.  The laptop's keyboard is decent enough that it can
    replace the thinkpad keyboard I've been using for the last couple of years
    -- it's a high-end Dell, and has both a pointing stick and a middle
    button.  (The middle button has part of the Unix desktop environment since
    the mid 1980s; it means "paste", and I use it all the time.) The monitors
    are about 50% bigger, pixel-wise, than the laptop, and are arranged
    "traditionally" with the laptop on the left.
</p>
<p> You can probably see the problem with this arrangement.  The total
    workspace is about 7000 pixels wide, and it's not even arranged in a
    straight line -- to get from the laptop to the "middle" monitor you have
    to move the cursor to the right, but the natural direction would be
    straight up.  What's more, when you undock the laptop the whole thing
    collapses down to a "mere" 1920x1080.  It's no wonder that most of the
    programmers in my team have opted for a single 30" monitor, and keep their
    laptop (almost invariably a mac) closed while they're using it.
</p>
<p> Fortunately, I anticipated this problem months ago, and started using a
    window manager called xmonad.
</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p> One of the things I love most about Linux is the fact that the program
    that manages the layout of the screen and the behavior and appearance of
    the windows on it is <em>not</em> part of the operating system.  It's a
    separate program, sensibly called a "window manager", and it runs in user
    space as a perfectly ordinary application that just happens to have a
    couple of extra hooks into X, which is the (also ordinary) program that
    actually controls the display, the keyboard, and the mouse.
</p>
<p> Being an ordinary program -- and not even a terribly complicated one --
    anybody can write one, and many people have.  For a long time I was using
    one called TWM (Tabbed Window Manager, but the T originally stood for
    Tom's).  Later I started using CTWM (Claude's Tabbed Window Manager),
    because it introduced the then unfamiliar notion of multiple workspaces.
    (Before CTWM, these could only be found in an experimental system at Xerox
    where they were called "rooms".  Apple introduced them decades later, as
    part of MacOS X.)
</p>
<p> You've probably heard of Gnome, KDE, and Ubuntu's horrible Unity desktop
    environments.  Down at the bottom, they're just window managers plus a
    couple of utilities for doing things like putting up the familiar bar
    (Gnome calls it a "panel") full of menus, launcher buttons, clocks and
    other widgets.  You can, in fact, run <code>gnome-panel</code> under any
    window manager, and I did for a while.  They also include a "session
    manager", which handles things like starting the panel and making sure
    that applications get notified when you log out, so that they can save
    their state and exit cleanly.  I've been using Gnome for years, and loved
    it for its configurability.
</p>
<p> But Gnome's configurability comes with a cost -- every time you move to a
    new computer, you have to spend an hour clicking around in control panels
    and property windows to get everything set up the way you like it.  And
    every time there's a major upgrade, something is a little different.  It's
    a cost I no longer have to pay.
