<p> Since I've noticed that a couple of new folks have either joined LJ, or
    posted after a long absence, and
    since I just spouted off a comment describing the basic HTML tags, here's
    another take on it, with the rough edges smoothed off.  
</p>
<p> <b>Here are the essential tags for LJ.</b>  You can get away with nothing
    but these, and let LJ's automatic formatting take care of everything else.
</p>

<p> Inside of paragraphs, &lt;em&gt; (emphasis), &lt;strong&gt; (bold), and
    occasionally &lt;cite&gt; (italics, used for citations) &lt;code&gt;
    (fixed-width), and &lt;del&gt; (strike-out). You can also use &lt;i&gt;,
    &lt;b&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;, and &lt;s&gt;, but it's considered cheating.
    &lt;u&gt; (underline) can also be used, but it's confusing given the
    almost universal convention that <u>links</u> are underlined.  See what I
    mean?   
</p>
<p> &lt;hr&gt; (horizontal rule) and &lt;img&gt; (image) have their uses; they
    are  two of the three tags that do not need to be "closed" (see inside the cut).
    &lt;img&gt; tags need two "attributes" between the "img" and the "&gt;":
    <code>src="<em>url-of-image</em>"</code> to point to the image, and
    <code>alt="<em>text</em>"</code> to specify the text that a blind person
    or search engine will see <em>in place of</em> the image.  If an image is
    just there as a spacer or decoration, you can use
    <code>alt="&nbsp;"</code>.
</p>
<p> The final essential tag is
    &lt;a&nbsp;href="<em>url</em>"&gt;anchor-text&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a
    link.  The "a" comes from "anchor", for reasons that are now mainly
    historical.  On Livejournal, there are two more handy tags that turn into
    special kinds of link:  &lt;lj&nbsp;user="<em>username</em>"&gt; (which
    doesn't need to be closed) links to a user's profile and journal, and
    &lt;lj-cut&gt;...&lt;/lj-cut&gt; cuts out a long block of text and
    replaces it with a link.  Add a <code>text="link-text"</code> attribute to
    replace the default "details".
</p>
<lj-cut text="The rest is mostly useful outside of LJ.  This is long enough, and probably boring enough, that it needs a cut"> 
<p> First of all, don't worry too much about the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;,
    &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tags.  If you're on LJ or some other
    blogging system, they'll be supplied automagically.  Most editors will put
    them in as well.  If not, you can always copy them from some other page.
</p>
<p> Secondly, almost all tags have to be "closed" -- if something starts with,
    for example, &lt;foo&gt;, you have to close it with &lt;/foo&gt;,
    otherwise the browser won't know where to stop fooing.  If you see a page
    that's all italics or bold, that's probably why.  In practice you can get
    away with not closing paragraphs and list items, but it's not advisable.  
    Browsers handle it OK, but some templating systems -- including LJ's -- have trouble.
    Tags like &lt;br&gt; that are "self-closing" can be marked with a slash before
    the final "&gt;" (i.e.,  &lt;br /&gt;) to make them XML-compatible -- this hybrid
    is called XHTML and you mostly don't need to worry about it.
</p>
<p></p>
<p> The most essential tag is &lt;p&gt;, which sets off a paragraph.  You
    mostly don't need it in LJ, which automatically turns the end of a line
    into a &lt;br&gt; tag, which "breaks" a line.  &lt;br&gt; is one of the
    three tags that don't have to be closed.  If you want to use &lt;p&gt;, or
    <em>any</em> of the fancy stuff mentioned here, on LJ, <em>turn off 
    auto-formatting</em> or you'll get lots of extra white space.
</p>
<p> The headings, &lt;h1&gt; thru &lt;h6&gt;. In practice I use &lt;h1&gt;
    only for page titles, and rarely if ever go down as far as &lt;h4&gt;.
</p>
<p> The lists: &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; for bulletted (unordered) and
    numbered (ordered) lists, using &lt;li&gt; for list items; &lt;dl&gt; for
    "definition" lists, with &lt;dt&gt; for "defined terms" and &lt;dd&gt; for
    "definition data".
</p>
<p> You can get an indented block of text, commonly used for long quotations,
    by enclosing it in &lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
</p>
<p> Tables add a whole level of complication, and are rarely worth the trouble
    unless (a) you really need a table, or (b) you want to make a pretty
    layout without using css styles.  Just for reference, enclose the whole
    table in a &lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;, and each row in
    &lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;.  Table headings are enclosed in
    &lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt;, and ordinary table data in
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;.  You can spend lots of time tweaking tables to
    get them to look right.  It's rarely worthwhile.
</p>
<p> One more attribute is often handy:  <code>align="..."</code>.  The value
    can be <code>"left"</code>, <code>"right"</code>, or
    <code>"center"</code>, and you can use them on images, paragraphs, or
    table data.  To center a whole range of paragraphs, use
    &lt;div&nbsp;align="center"&gt; 
</p>
<p> And just for completeness, there are these things called "entities" that are used
    to get special characters (like "&lt;") into ordinary text.  They all start with 
    an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a semicolon (;).  The most useful ones -- absolutely
    essential, in fact -- are <code>&amp;amp;</code> for "ampersand" (&amp;),  
    <code>&amp;lt;</code> for "less than" (&lt;), and
    <code>&amp;gt;</code> for "greater than" (&gt;).  Another handy one is 
    <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> for "non-breaking space" -- it looks like a space, but
    the browser treats it as a letter and so won't allow it to turn into a line break.  Good if
    you want to keep an entire phrase, computer command, or tag example on one line.
</lj-cut>
<p> So there you have it.  For more details, all the rest of the tags and
    attributes I've left out, and an excellent reference, see <a
