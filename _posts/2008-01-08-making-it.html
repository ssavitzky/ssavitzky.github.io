<p> "If you want something to get done, ask a busy person to do it."
    I haven't been accomplishing much lately, so obviously I'm not busy
    enough.  
</p>
<p> There are several seemingly-unrelated projects going on in the household
    at the moment: I'm starting my next album, the <lj site="livejournal.com" user="chaoswolf"> is
    starting an HTML class, the servers are getting re-organized, and people
    have been after the <lj site="livejournal.com" user="flower_cat"> to write a cookbook.  Meanwhile
    I've been thinking about writing my blog locally and mirroring it up to
    LJ.
</p>
<p> They're all more closely related than one might think.  
</p>

<p> You see, I'm a geek.  I think nothing of writing <a
    href="http://thestarport.org/Steve_Savitzky/Tools/" >a big pile of
    Makefile templates and Perl scripts</a> to cobble an album, a songbook,
    and multiple websites together from the same set of sources.  The Cat is
    emphatically <em>not</em> a geek, she wants to be able to type recipes in,
    maybe to a text editor or a blog client, and have them magically assembled
    into a cookbook.  And a website, of course.  Hmmm.
</p>
<lj-cut text="some geeky details">
<p> Meanwhile, I've been dissatisfied with the available "content management
    systems" (a category which includes blogs and wikis as well as monstrous
    enterprise document management systems like <a
    href="http://www.alfresco.com/" >Alfresco</a> (which is pretty damned
    cool, but then I <em>like</em> monsters, not just ponies and monkeys.  But
    I digress).  Partly this is because most of them don't let me use my own
    version-control tools and my own editor, and essentially <em>none</em> of
    them take advantage of <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p> Not even <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/" >ikiwiki</a> and <a
    href="blosxom.com" >blosxom</a>, which probably come closest to what I've
    been working on.  
</p>
<p> I <em>like</em> my tools.  They pull together metadata from a variety of
    places, including (for example) song lyric files, recording projects,
    and local metadata files, and build CD masters, ripped files, playlists,
    annotated track listings, and multiple web pages.  They could do that for
    cookbooks, too.  Or blogs.
</p>
<p> What <code>make</code> is, fundamentally, a program for working out
    dependencies  and following rules to run the commands that rebuild
    whatever depends on the files that changed since the last time you did
    it.  This is just what <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/" >ikiwiki</a> and <a
    href="blosxom.com" >blosxom</a> do, only they do it with massive Perl
    scripts that rumble over your directory tree and figure out what's been
    changed and follow rules to...  Right.  Why reinvent <code>make</code>?
</p>
<p> The tools have to allow varying degrees of participation:  public comments
    similar to blogs, but also more intense collaboration on editing and
    recording.  I'm not going to be shipping pre-order bonus disks this time
    around: I want to sell subscriptions to the development process. 
</p>
</lj-cut>
<p> ... So that's the plan: to refactor my CD, concert, and web tools so that
    they work for assembling books and blogs as well, publish to hardcopy as
    well as on multiple websites, and do it in a way that's extensible (with
    plug-ins), collaborative, and simple enough to be used by non-geeks.
</p>
<p> I'm probably going to need a lot of help with that last part.
