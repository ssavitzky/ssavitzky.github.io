<p> A few days ago I got a <a
    href="http://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1587382.html?thread=4489654#cmt4489654"
    >comment</a> on my weekly post that went <a
    href="http://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1587382.html?thread=4489654#cmt4489654"
    >Oohh, you're doing what looks to me like a bullet journal? Only
    online.</a> So I wrote a quick explanation.  And then I realized that I
    might be doing something unusual, that I ought to write up in more detail.
    So here you are:

<h2>The Legend</h2>

<p> Let's start off with the file called <code>Journals/Dog/legend.do</code>:

<pre>
			       ===legend.do===

= item flag notation for to.do and to.done files:

= notation for to.do and to.done items:
  = note: keep  o to do  * done  x abandoned  ~ modified  . in progress
  & added after completion  (recurring items get * when completed)
  $ financial transaction (flagged as  o before completion)
  ? query/decision...  - choice  + chosen  ->chosen
  @ link/research
  ! emotion noted at the time, or soon after.  NOT added the next morning; 
    I'm trying to pay more attention at the time
  | body sensation worthy of note: pain, noticable change...
    (more recently replaced by %; should maybe go back to |)
  : observation or external event.  Weather, news, etc
    + external observation with positive emotional content
    - external observation with negative emotional content
  % observation/insight about myself
  # meta - flags, flist, filters, ...
  &lt;b>...something I feel good about...&lt;/b> (may be added next day)
  &lt;i>...something I feel bad about...&lt;/i>
  [ ... ] delete from public posts
  ... ongoing items
  " quotation
  ' interior dialog

= Notation for meetings and conversations:
  &lt;- point to bring up.  After meeting, point to bring up next time
  *- point brought up
  x- point not brought up
  ~- point partially brought up, or brought up in different form
  &- additional point raised  
  -> information/point raised by someone else/consequence/resolution
  => action item for me
  =* action item done
  <= action item for somebody else.

</pre>

<h2>The History</h2>

<p> My usage has shifted a little over the years.  I first started posting
    "to.do" items around 2006, though I'd undoubtedly been using at least the
    o and * flags for years before that.  At first, since I was part of a
    support group working on procrastination and avoidance, I used it as an
    accountability thing: I would post a list of open items, followed
    (hopefully) by the items as they got checked in.  It was a little
    discouraging, until somebody suggested just posting about what I'd
    <em>done</em>.  That led to &, and my expanded use of the file as more a
    log than a to-do list and calendar.

<p> Whenever the list of "done" items got too long, I would move them into a
    ".done" file -- the first one I have is 2006.done.  In 2009 I switched to
    quarterly archives; by 2009/q4.done the file had most of its present
    features.  By 2011 I was archiving monthly.  I don't remember offhand when
    I stopped making daily posts in LJ and switched to weekly.

<p> Sometime in September of 2011 I decided that the set of unfinished and
    probably never-to-be-completed items had gotten too long, and moved it to
    <code>wibnif.do</code>, as in "Wouldn't It Be Nice If..."  My present
    Makefile plugin reports the current number of unfinished items in to.do
    and wibnif.do; the current numbers are 70 and 126 respectively.

<h2>The Files</h2>

<p> So there's that.  The file is called <code>to.do</code>, and edited with
    emacs.  There are a couple of important marker lines in it:

<pre>
=========================================================================================+
Ongoing:                                                                             89->|
<em>recurring items and long-term goals go here</em>
=then===================================================================================>|
<em>this contains entries from the first of the month to the present</em>
=now===-^-===this-month-v-==============================================================>|
<em>scheduled items for later this month</em>
=later===-v-===this-month-^-============================================================>|
<em>scheduled items after this month</em>
=sometime===-V-===later-^-==============================================================>|
<em>items with no specific due date</em>
=Done-v-================================================================================>|
</pre>
<p> Dates, in the form mmddWw (e.g., 0122Su), start in the first column; flag
    characters are indented two spaces.  The marker at column 89 makes it easy
    to properly size the editor window when I first open it after rebooting;
    it's where lines wrap.

<p> I'll put approximately-scheduled items in the this-month and later
    sections after the dated entries, and a few of the more important ones
    <em>above</em> =now.  That doesn't keep me from procrastinating them, but
    it does help keep them where they'll be noticed.

<p> Note that, except for the breakpoint at =done, entries are in
    chronological order from top to bottom.  That makes this a <em>log</em>,
    not a blog or feed.  My to.do and its associated history (see below) are
    one of a handful of journal-like collections under my Journals directory;
    the to.Do lOG is kept in a a directory called Dog.

<h2>The Archives</h2>

<p> By now, I have a fairly well-established routine:
<ul>
  <li> I maintain the to.do file using emacs, of course.  
  <li> Sometime on Sunday, I move the last week's worth of entries from the
       working location near the top of the file, to the end.
  <li> At this point I still have the week's entries in the Region (emacs
       terminology for the current selection).  I move point down two lines to
       scoop up the HTML boilerplate that I'll need for my weekly post, and
       copy (M-w).
  <li> Then I run <code>lj-update</code>, currently bound to M-L, and yank
       into the body.  The boilerplate is arranged so that all I have to do is
       move back up two lines, cut, down one, and yank.
  <li> From there it's an easy step to go back to the first line (which is
       invariably the start date) copy it, and yank it into the subject line.
  <li> Write my summary.  Edit out any [...] sections, if necessary.
  <li> Post.
</ul>
<p> Then,
<ul>
  <li> Every month -- actually, on the first Sunday of the month, after making
       my weekly post -- I move the month's entries to yyyy/mm.done.
  <li> Every so often I go through and pull out obsolete entries, marking them
       with * or x as appropriate, and put them after the preceeding week's
       entries at the end of the file.
  <li> Every year, on New Year's Eve, I gather up my list of goals and make my
       <a href="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1586341.html">end-of-the-year
       post</a>.
  <li> The next day, I cons up my new list of goals and make a <a
       href="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1585429.html" >New Year's
       post</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p> I keep other, project-specific, to.do files.  Most of them are much
    simpler, with undated items above the =done line (which is usually just a
    line of equal signs), and dated items after it in what I now call a "work
    log".  It's convenient, because I can just go to the end of the file and
    make an entry, but it wouldn't work nearly as well if I had to schedule
    things.
