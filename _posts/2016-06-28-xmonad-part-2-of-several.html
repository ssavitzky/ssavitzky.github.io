<p> (You may want to start with <a
    href="http://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1573035.html" >Part 1</a>)
</p>
<p> Xmonad is a <em>tiling</em> window manager.  That means that, with very
    few exceptions, it lays out all of the windows in your workspace so that
    they completely fill the screen.  You can have multiple layouts, and flip
    between them with a single keystroke.  You can bring a workspace (there
    are 9 by default, but you can add more) to your screen with a single
    keystroke, or send a window to a workspace.
</p>
<p> And the whole thing is configured using a text file that is actually a
    program, written in the functional language Haskell.  I'll get to that
    later. 
</p>


<p> One of my main gripes about Gnome, etc., and one of the things I miss the
    most about CTWM, is that when you first start a program its window shows
    up at some random location on the screen, with whatever size the program
    thinks is appropriate.  If you don't like those choices you have to move
    and resize the window yourself, and then do it all over the next time you
    log in.  (There are some exceptions -- many newer programs remember where
    you put them last, and older programs, from the CTWM era, can be given a
    starting geometry.)
</p>
<p> Xmonad's layouts are all deterministic, which is to say, predictable.
    When you start a program, you know <em>exactly</em> where it's going to be
    on the screen.  When you change the layout, you know where everything is
    going to go.  If you want to move a window into the main position (most
    layouts have one; e.g. the left-hand column) it's (as usual) just one
    keystroke to put it there.
</p>
<p> But the best thing, and the reason I switched to xmonad in the first
    place, is the way it treats multiple monitors: it simply assigns one
    workspace to each monitor.
</p>
<p> Undock your laptop, and its screen stays exactly the same.  The workspaces
    that were shown on the other screens simply go back into hiding with all
    the others, and are still only a keystroke away.  When you have multiple
    screens, you can move a window to another screen, or bring a workspace to
    a screen, or <em>warp the pointer to another screen</em>, all with single
    keystrokes. 
</p>
<p> When you go to a conference room and plug in a projector, a workspace
    immediately shows up there and its layout automatically adjusts to the
    projector's resolution and aspect ratio.  When you get a new computer --
    all the developers at work got new laptops just a month or two ago -- just
    copy your configuration files to it and everything will be exactly the
    same as it was on the old one.  (Sometime later I'll write about my
    portable configuration, which makes it possible for me to set up my entire
    working environment in mere minutes.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> So let's go a little deeper into those magic keystrokes.  First of all,
    you have to know that all of the commands (you can't really call them
    shortcuts) include a key that xmonad calls "Mod" (short for "modifier", of
    course).  Mod is initially defined as Alt, but the first thing any Emacs
    user is going to do is redefine it as something else, usually the "logo"
    key.  (That's the one on the left between Ctrl and Alt that usually has a
    Windows logo on it.  If your keyboard has replaceable keys you may be able
    to get a penguin for it.)  On old laptops that don't have a logo key I use
    Ctrl-Alt, but that's a matter of taste.
</p>
<p> You also probably want to know that Mod-? gets you a list of all the
    commands.  And that there's a fantastic collection of tutorials,
    documentation, and sample configuration files at <a
    href="http://xmonad.org/" >xmonad.org</a>.
</p>
<p> When xmonad starts up, you see a totally empty, black screen.  Most
    people, myself included, add a status/navigation bar at the top, but you
    don't have to.  I'll get to that later.  You can start a program by typing
    Mod-P, or open a terminal window with Mod-Shift-Enter.  You will
    immediately notice that the first window you open fills the screen.  If
    you open another, xmonad will tile the screen with them, showing them side
    by side.
</p>
<p> If you start a third program, it will get added to the right-hand column.
    You can probably see where this is going.  When you move the mouse pointer
    into a window, it gets a thin red border to show you that it has "focus".
</p>
<p> If you decide that you started things in the wrong order, move the pointer
    into the window you want to put in the left-hand column (the "master"
    column) and hit Mod-Enter.  You close a window you're done with using
    Mod-Shift-C. 
</p>
<p> Here's where it gets interesting: Mod-Space will switch you to a new
    <em>layout</em>, with the master column turning into a master
    <em>row</em>, and all the other windows across the bottom.  Hit Mod-Space
    again, and the currently-focused window goes full-screen.  (I reconfigure
    my full-screen layout to put a row of tabs across the top.  Wondering how
    to see the hidden windows?  Mod-Tab moves focus to the next window in the
    stack.  It also works in other layouts, so you don't need the mouse to
    move focus around.  If you spend most of your time in a terminal and an
    editor like vim or emacs, you can throw your mouse away and still be
    productive.  Mod-Shift-Tab moves focus to the previous window.
</p>
<p> Mod-2 puts you into a second <em>workspace.</em>  There are nine of them.  (I
    add two more -- 0 and -.)  If you want to move a window, say from
    workspace 2 to workspace 1, use Mod-Shift-1.  That's kind of a recurring
    theme in xmonad -- Mod-something does one thing, and Mod-Shift-something
    does something related.
</p>
<p> You can see that in action if you add an(other) monitor.  Now, workspace 1
    is in the left-hand screen, and 2 is in the right-hand screen.  Think of
    the two of them as West and East.
</p>
<p> Now, Mod-w will move the focus (and the mouse pointer) into the West
    screen, and Mod-e will move the focus into the East screen.  Mod-1 through
    Mod-9 will bring that workspace into whatever screen has the focus.  If
    the other workspace was already visible, they trade places.  (Some people
    don't like that, so you can change it so that it just moves focus into the
    other screen if you select a workspace that's already visible.)
</p>
<p> Add a third screen to the right of East, and call it Right.  Now, Mod-r
    and Mod-Shift-R do exactly what you would expect.  (There are no bindings
    for T, so I suppose that if you have space for a fourth screen you could
    use it for that.)
</p>
<p> There are more key bindings, to move focus (Mod-j and Mod-k focus the next
    and previous window, respectively; shifted, they swap the focused window
    with the next or previous window), to shrink and enlarge the master area
    (Mod-h and Mod-l respectively), or increase or decrease the number of
    windows in the master area (Mod-Comma and Mod-Period respectively).
