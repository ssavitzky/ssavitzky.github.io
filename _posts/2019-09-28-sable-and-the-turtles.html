title: "Sable and the turtles: laptop configuration made easy"
---

<p> I recently bought a new-to-me <a
    href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X230">Thinkpad X230</a>, and
    in keeping with my ongoing theme of naming thinkpads after their color, I
    called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable" >Sable</a>, which
    in addition to being the heraldic name for the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable_(heraldry)" >colour black</a> is
    also a small dark-brown animal in the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae" >mustelid (weasel)</a>
    family.

<p> I've become quite fond of Sable.  It's only an inch wider than my former
    laptop, Cygnus (named after <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1" >Cygnus X-1</a>, the first
    X-ray source to be widely accepted as a black hole), about ten times
    faster, and the same weight.  The extra inch makes it <em>exactly</em> the
    right size for me to put one of my Thinkpad USB keyboards flat on top of
    it.  One may wonder why I would even want to do this, but I can move the
    keyboard to my lap when one of the cats wants to sit on my desk. (The cat
    is almost always Desti, who is also black, but naming a laptop after her
    would be confusing.)

<p> Anyway.

<p> One of the problems with getting a new computer is getting it configured
    the way I want it, which usually means "pretty much the same as the last
    one".  Most people do this by copying as much as they can off the old one,
    (on Linux that's typically their entire home directory), and then
    installing the same collection of applications (packages, in Linux
    terminology).  It's tedious, and when the architectures or operating
    system versions are different it leads to a wide range of random glitches
    and outright bugs that have to be tracked down individually over the
    course of the next week or so.  Even if it doesn't, home directories tend
    to include a large amount of random stuff, like downloads and the contents
    of your browser cache, that you <em>don't</em> necessarily want.

<p> And if you're trying to set up a home directory on your web host, or your
    work machine, or something tiny like a <a
    href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" >Raspberry Pi</a>, well...  What you
    really want to do is start afresh and just install what you really need.

<p> That's where the turtles (<a
    href="https://steve.savitzky.net/Songs/windward/" >because home is
    wherever you carry your shell</a>, as it says in the song) come in.
    Specifically, <a href="https://github.com/ssavitzky/Honu" >Honu</a>, which
    is a collection of makefiles and scripts that does almost all of the setup
    automagically.

<p> Honu (Hawaiian for the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle" >green sea
    turtle</a>) requires nothing more than a shell (the Linux/Unix
    command-line processor, and anything Posix-compatible will work), an <a
    href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh" >SSH client</a>, the <a
    href="https://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git.html" >git</a>
    version-control system, and <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" >make</a>.  In
    fact, if you can install packages on your target system, the first thing
    Honu's bootstrap script will do is install the ones you don't have.

<p> Make was one of the first programs for building software automatically,
    and I'm very fond of it.  It lets you define "recipes" -- actually, short
    shell scripts -- for building files out of their "dependencies", and it's
    clever enough to only build the things that are out of date.  It can also
    follow rules, like the built-in one that tells it how to use the C
    compiler to turn a <code>.c</code> file into a <code>.o</code> object
    file, and the linker to turn a <code>.o</code> file to an executable file.
    (On Windows the executable file would end in an extension of
    <code>.exe</code>, but Unix and its descendents don't need it.)

<p> Make can also follow chains of rules, so if your source file changes it
    will rebuild the executable, and (unless you tell it not to) delete the
    object file after it's sure nothing else needs it.  And rules don't have
    to result in actual files -- if you give it a recipe for a "phony" target it
    will simply notice that it isn't there, and run the recipe every time.
    This is good for things like "install-pkgs" and "install", which are
    Honu's main make targets.  

<p> Turn it loose with a <code>make</code> command, and Honu's makefiles
    happily go about installing packages, creating directories, and setting up
    configuration files ; the whole process takes well under an hour.

<p> I wrote Honu to be pretty generic -- it knows a lot of my preferences, but
    it doesn't know my name, email address, current projects, or hosting
    service.  I also have another package, Mathilda (our name for the
    particular happy honu who narrates "<a
    href="https://steve.savitzky.net/Songs/windward/" >Windward</a>").
    Mathilda sets all of <em>that</em> up, pulling down the Git repositories
    for my current projects, blog archives, websites, songbooks, build
    systems, and so on; putting them in the right places so that I can sit
    down in front of Sable, open the lid, and be right at home.

<p> ...Except, as in most moving projects, for tracking down all the little
    pieces that got left behind, but that only took a couple of days.
