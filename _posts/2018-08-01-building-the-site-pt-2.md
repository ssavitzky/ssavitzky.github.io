## ... and one step back

### Theme

Unfortunately, the theme I want to use, [https://html5up.net/read-only](HTML5
UP's Read Only), isn't a Jekyll theme, and on investigation it looks like
converting it will be a nightmare.  So let's just copy the design.  Here's
what we need:

  * The nav is a large green rectangle on the right-hand side of the screen.
    * it has a large round avatar image at the top, 
	* the page title
	* nav links.  The nav links scroll the main page, but I don't want that --
	  I want separate pages.  That makes it easy.
  * The nav stays put when the page scrolls.  That may cause trouble if I have
	a lot of links -- which I probably will.
  * There is a full-width image at the top of the page.  Looks like its height
	is roughly equal to the nav's width.  I may want to replace that with
	actual text similar to the header on the current
	[https://stephen.savitzky.net](S.S.net) site.
	
#### AHA!

Found it by searching _GitHub_ and finding [mattvh/jekyllthemes: A directory
of the best-looking themes for Jekyll
blogs](https://github.com/mattvh/jekyllthemes).  The corresponding Google
Pages site has 100 _pages_ of thumbnails, so the obvious thing to do was
search the `_posts` directory, which is the _source_ for that gallery.
Bingo: [jekyllthemes/2015-08-20-read-only.markdown at master Â·
mattvh/jekyllthemes](https://github.com/mattvh/jekyllthemes/blob/master/_posts/2015-08-20-read-only.markdown),
which points to
[old-jekyll-templates/Read-Only-Jekyll-Theme](https://github.com/old-jekyll-templates/Read-Only-Jekyll-Theme) 
	
The instructions for actually _using_ it are pretty well hidden, but
[benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme: Jekyll plugin for building Jekyll sites with
any GitHub-hosted theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) 	
appears to be the place for it.  Of course it doesn't work.

There are 50-odd forks.  All of them appear tothave simply built a blog on top
of it.  Most are ancient.
[LiberLibrum/LiberLibrum.github.io](https://github.com/LiberLibrum/LiberLibrum.github.io)
has a working site, but my guess is that it's using an older version of Jekyll
(styles in /sass rather than _sass).  The only layouts are post and
landing-page, and the styles are in `/sass` instead of `/_sass`.  Only way to
salvage it is to fork it and take an axe to it.  Real hackers use an axe.

Alternatively, just say "inspired by" and fake it.  How hard can it be to
style a green rectangle?  (Famous last words?)
