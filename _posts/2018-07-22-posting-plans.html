<p> In <a

    >comments on "Done Since 2018-07-15"</a> we started having a discussion of
    mirroring and cross-posting DW blog entries, and in particular what my
    plans are for implementing personal blog sites that mirror all or some of
    a -- <em>this</em> -- Dreamwidth journal.

<p> Non-techie readers might conceivably want to skip this post.

<h3>Where I am now:</h3>

<p> Right now, my blog posting process is, well, let's just say
    <em>idiosyncratic</em>.  Up until sometime late last year, I was posting
    using an Emacs major mode called <code>lj-update-mode</code>; it was
    pretty good.  It had only two significant problems:
<ol>
  <li> It could only create one post at a time, and there was no good way to
       save a draft and come back to it later.  I could live with that.
  <li> It stopped working when DW switched to all HTTPS.  It was using an
       obsolete http library, and noone was maintaining either of them.
</ol>
<p> My current system is much better.
<ol>
  <li> I run a command, either <code>make&nbsp;draft</code> or, if I'm pretty
       sure I'm going to post immediately, <code>make&nbsp;entry</code>.  I
       pass the filename, without the yyyy/mm/dd prefix, along with an
       optional title.  If I don't pass the title I can add it later.  The
       draft gets checked in with git; I can find out when I started by using
       <code>git&nbsp;log</code>. 
  <li> I edit the draft.  It can sit around for days or months; doesn't
       matter.  It' an ordinary html file except that it has an email-like
       header with the metadata in it.
  <li> When I'm done, I <code>make&nbsp;post</code>.  Done.  If I'm posting a
       draft I have to pass the filename again to tell it <em>which</em>
       draft; <code>make&nbsp;entry</code> makes a symlink to the entry, which
       is already in a file called
       <code>yyyy/mm/dd-<em>filename</em>.html</code>.  It gets posted,
       and committed in git with a suitable commit message.
</ol>
<p> You can see the code in <a
    href="https://github.com/ssavitzky/MakeStuff/tree/master/blogging"
    >MakeStuff/blogging</a> on GitHub.  It depends on a Python client called
    <a href="https://github.com/ssavitzky/charm" ><code>charm</code></a>,
    which I forked to add the Location: header and some sane defaults like not
    auto-formatting.  Charm is mostly useless -- it does almost everything
    using a terminal-based text editor.  Really?  But it does have a
    "quick-post" mode that takes metadata on the command line, and a "sync"
    mode that you can use to sync your journal with an archive.  Posts in the
    archive are almost, but not quite, in the same format as the MakeStuff
    archive; the main difference is that the filenames look like
    <code>yyyy/mm/dd_HHMM</code>.  Close, but not quite there.

<p> There's another advantage that isn't apparent in the code: you can add
    custom make targets that set up your draft using a template.  For example,
    my "Done since ..." posts are started with <code>make&nbsp;done</code>,
    and my "<a href="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/tag/curmudgeon" >Computer
    Curmudgeon</a>" posts are started with <code>make&nbsp;curmudgeon</code>.
    There are other shortcuts for River and S4S posts.  I also have multiple
    directories for drafts, separated roughly by subject, but all posting into
    the same archive.

<h3>Where I want to go:</h3>

<p> Here's what I want next:

<ul>
  <li> The ability to post in either HTML or markdown -- markdown has a great
       toolchain, including the ability to syntax-color your code blocks.
  <li> The ability to <em>edit</em> posts by editing the archived post and
       uploading it.  Right now it's a real pain to keep them in sync.
  <li> A unified archive, with <em>actual URLs in the metadata</em> rather
       than just the date and time in the filename.
  <li> The ability to put all or part of my blog on <em>different sites.</em>
       I really want the computer-related posts to go on <a
       href="https://stephen.savitzky.net/">Stephen.Savitzky.net</a> (usually
       shortened to S.S.net in my notes), and a complete mirror on <a
       href="https://steve.savitzky.net/">steve.savitzky.net</a> (s.s.net).
  <li> Cross-links in both directions between my sites and DW.
</ul>

<h3>How to get there:</h3>

<p> Here's a very brief sketch of what needs to be done.  It's only vaguely in
    sequence, and I've undoubtedly left parts out.  But it's a start.

<h4>Posting, editing, and archiving</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Posting in HTML or markdown is a pretty easy one; I can do that just by
       modifying the makefiles and (probably) changing the final extension
       from <code>.html</code> to <code>.posted</code> so that make can apply
       its usual dependency-inference magic.
  <li> Editing and a unified archive will <em>both</em> require a new
       command-line client.  There aren't any.  There <em>are</em> libraries,
       in Ruby, Haskell, and Javascript, that I can wrap a program around.
       (The Python code in <code>charm</code> doesn't look worth saving.)  I
       wanted to learn Ruby anyway.
  <li> The unified archive will also require a program that can go back in
       time and match up archived posts with the right URLs, reconcile the two
       file naming conventions, and remove the duplicates that are due to
       archiving posts both in <code>charm</code> and <code>MakeStuff</code>.
       Not too hard, and it only has to be done once.
  <li> It would be nice to be able to archive comments, too.  The old
       <code>ljbackup</code> program can do it, so it's feasible.  It's in
       Perl, so it might be a good place to start.
</ul>

<h4>Mirror, mirror, on the server...</h4>

<p> This is a separate section because it's mostly orthogonal to the posting,
    archiving, etc.  
<ul>
  <li> The only part of the posting section that really needs to be done first
       is the first one, changing the extension of archived posts to
       <code>.posted</code>.  (That's because <code>make</code> uses
       extensions to figure out what rules to apply to get from one to
       another.  Remind me to post about <code>make</code> some time.)
  <li> The post archive may want to have its own git repository.
  <li> Templating and styling.  My websites are starting to show their age;
       there's nothing really wrong with a retro look, but they also aren't
       responsive (to different screen sizes -- that's important when most
       people are reading websites on their phones), or accessible
       (screen-reader friendly and navigable by keyboard; having different
       font sizes helps here, too).  Any respectable static site generator can
       do it -- you may remember <a
       href="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/1618191.html" >this post on The
       Joy of Static Sites</a> -- but the way I'm formatting my metadata will
       require some custom work.  Blosxom and nanoblogger are probably the
       closest, but they're ancient.  I probably ought to resist the
       temptation to roll my own.
</ul>

<p> Yeah.  Right.
