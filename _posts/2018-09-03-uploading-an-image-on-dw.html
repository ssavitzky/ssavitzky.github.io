<p> This started out in a comment, but I think enough people may be struggling
    with DW's relatively new image upload feature that it's worth making it
    into a post.  And it's a good excuse for posting.

<blockquote>
<p> (aside: The key to all of this is knowing enough about HTML to be able to
    identify the correct URL and create the img tag to refer to it -- it
    probably all looks like black magic to somebody who hasn't been doing this
    stuff for the last few years.  Don't expect to get it all on one reading.)

<p> You might also want to know some terminology.  Those things enclosed in
    angle brackets are commonly called "tags".  The things with a name, an
    equals sign, and something in quotes are called "attributes".  And single
    and double quotes are identical in effect, but have to match: you can't
    start with a single and end with a double.

<p> So -- I uploaded an image; down at the bottom there's a box labeled Image
    Code.  Copy, paste:
<pre>
  &lt;a href='https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg'&gt;
     &lt;img src='https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/100x100/352.jpg'
         title='Cat and mouse'
           alt='Grey tabby cat looking intently at a Logitech mouse.'  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p> (That's what it looked like, except that I wrapped the lines to make it
    clearer.)

<p> Looking at that line of HTML I can see that there's an img tag that, from the
    <code>/100x100/</code> in its URL, looks like a thumbnail.  It's wrapped
    in a link -- an &lt;a...&gt tag.  The href attribute is
    <code>https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg</code>, which ought to be the
    full-sized image, so I'll get a preview just to make sure... 

<p> Then I clicked the "Preview" button, and it looked like this:
<p>   <a href='https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg'>
     <img src='https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/100x100/352.jpg'
         title='Cat and mouse'
           alt='Grey tabby cat looking intently at a Logitech mouse.'  /></a>

<p> Yup.  So <code>https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg</code> -- the
    <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>img</code> tag, is the URL of the
    actual image.  (At that point I could just as well have copied it out of
    the browser's location bar, since I was already looking at the full-sized
    image.  I didn't think of that, and just copied it out of the comment I
    was writing.)

<p> I can put that into an <code>img</code> tag that looks like 
    <pre>&lt:img src="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg" width="512"&gt;</pre>.

<p> Chrome says (in the page title) that the image is 1024x719, so I'll try
    cutting it down by adding a <code>width="512"</code> attribute.   
    Here we go:
<p> <img src="https://mdlbear.dreamwidth.org/file/352.jpg" width="512"> -- purrfect.

<blockquote>
<p> One final aside:  if you're following along and using a word processor
    that automagically turns quotation marks into matching <q>curly
    quotes</q>, you need to turn that feature <em>off</em> when you're editing
    HTML, because they won't be recognized as quotes.  If you're creating your
    post in your browser and you want to enter HTML directly, you need to
    click the "HTML" tab (over on the upper right).  The "Rich Text" setting
    will create HTML automatically and you'll need to click one of its little
    icons to create an actual image tag.
</blockquote>

<p> Happy hacking!
