I have spent the last couple of days backfilling the blog with a selection of
relevant posts from my Dreamwidth/Livejournal archive.  By the time I was done
this afternoon, I had [a script that does most of the work of
importing](https://github.com/ssavitzky/MakeStuff/blob/master/scripts/import-blog-entries),
and 20-odd new posts.  (Well, old posts.  New here.)  A little manual editing
is still required to correct the occasional tag that's unique to the original
blogging engine.  They cover much of my recent writing on security, software,
and the web.

I am resisting (so far) importing my entire blogging history (into a
*different* Jekyll site) just to see how badly it breaks.  Or if it doesn't,
how long it takes to render nearly 13,000 posts. (It's only 59Mb, so it
*would* fit in RAM.)

Anyway, they're here.  Enjoy.
