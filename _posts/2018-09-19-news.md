The site is almost presentable at this point; I have started to bring over
some blog entries/articles that were originally published elsewhere.  Most of
these were originally published in my personal blog, so they should be
considered cross-posts.  Articles that form a series can be grouped using
tags. 

One might wonder whether "articles", especially the ones that <em>weren't</em>
originally blog entries should be in a separate collection, or even multiple
collections.  Jekyll, however, doesn't make it easy to put a single page in
two places, and it would confuse search engines.  It <em>does</em> make it
easy to create a "landing page" for each tag of interest.
