<a title="KLone - Embedded Web Server and SDK" href="http://www.koanlogic.com/kl/cont/gb/html/klone.html">KLone - Embedded Web Server and SDK</a><blockquote>KLone is a fully-featured, multiplatform, web application development framework, targeted especially for embedded systems and appliances.

It is a self-contained solution which includes a web server and an SDK for creating WWW sites with both static and dynamic content. When using KLone, there's absolutely no need for any additional component: neither the HTTP/S server (e.g. Apache, Netscape, Roxen), nor the typical active pages engine (PHP, Perl, ASP, Python).

KLone does everything, and does it fast and small.

KLone blends the HTTP/S server application together with its content and configuration into a single executable file. The site developer writes his/her dynamic pages in C/C++ (in usual scripting style: <% /* code */ %>) and uses KLone to transform them into embeddable, compressed native code with the native C/C++ compiler. The result is then linked to the HTTP/S server skeleton to obtain one single, ROM-able, binary file. </blockquote> They don't call it "C server pages", but that's what it is.
