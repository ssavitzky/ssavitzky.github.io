<p> The title comes from <a
    href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html"
    >"Gin, Television, and Social Surplus" by Clay Shirky</a>.  Somebody asked
    him "where do people find the time?" to create something like Wikipedia.
    Wikipedia -- the whole thing, articles and edits and talk pages and
    translations -- represents some 100 million hours of human thought.  TV
    watching, in the US alone, amounts to some 200 <em>billion</em> hours
    every year.  That's 2,000 Wikipedia projects every year.
</p>
<p> Shirky points out that, in the years spanned by the Industrial
    Revolution, "The transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden,
    and so wrenching, that the only thing society could do to manage was to
    drink itself into a stupor for a generation."  Gin, and more gin. "And it
    wasn't until society woke up from that collective bender that we actually
    started to get the institutional structures that we associate with the
    industrial revolution today." 
</p>
<p> The equivalent, in the latter half of the 20th Century, was television.
    Society is only now waking up from <em>that</em> collective bender.  What
    are you doing with <em>your</em> free time?
</p>
<p> I'm not watching TV much these days.  Nor movies.  Nor listening to radio,
    even during my commute.  Nor even reading books and magazines.  I
    <em>am</em> still drugging myself -- I'm a product of my generation, not
    yet completely adapted to life in the 21st Century -- but my drug of
    choice these days is mostly LJ.  A decade ago it was Usenet.  At least my
    current drugs are interactive.
</p>
<p> Sometimes, my current drugs create things that last.  Some of my LJ
    content finds its way onto my website; my songs and essays are already
    there.  I'm working on it.  I came out with a CD over the course of two or
    three years in, basically, the time I saved by not watching TV.  I ought
    to try not reading LJ so much.
