Sometimes you just need a curmudgeon -- the old guy who sits at that desk in
the corner with his laptop and his coffee, knows the answer to almost every
question, and is stubborn and patient enough to _keep_ answering in six
different ways until you understand it.  He has lots of great stories about
the way things were in the old days, but his browser tabs have titles like
"ReactJS", "Elm", "What's next for GitHub?", and "Linux Weekly News".

"Curmudgeon" is usually defined as
"[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curmudgeon]{An ill-tempered (and frequently
old) person full of stubborn ideas or opinions.}".  A _computer_ curmudgeon,
on the other hand, tends to be shy around people and old enough to have
learned that swearing at software rarely gets results.  Stubbornness,
however, usually does.

Things <em>this</em> computer curmudgeon can do for you include:

* Teaching you how to use email, Slack, Signal, and Google to stay in touch
  with your grandkids (or your grandparents!)
* Helping you overcome a fear of computers.
* Showing you how to buy books online, and where to find thousand of free ones.
* Helping you set up a new computer, with awesome free software that runs on
  whatever operating system you like, and a desktop that works the way you
  expect it to.  I specialize in Linux, but I've been using -- and programming
  -- PCs since before Windows, and Macs since the Mac II.
* Helping you install Linux, or repair a broken upgrade.
* Helping you set up regular backups, 
* Helping you set up your printer.
* Helping you set up your web browser to keep sites from tracking you.
* Helping you set up a website with WordPress, Weebly, or GitHub Pages, and
  teaching you to how add your own content.
* Teaching you how to use Linux.
* Helping you set up a blazing fast static website, and teaching you how to
  make changes on it instead of calling him for help.
* Teaching you how to manage the website that some other consultant left you with
  before they moved away.
* Helping you learn to program, in your choice of languages -- and helping you
  choose the right one.
* Getting your team started using `git` and GitHub.
* Explaining how `git` works and exactly why it's awesome.
* Automating common tasks with shell scripts.
* Talking to your group about the history of personal computers, the history
  of programming languages, (or any of a dozen other topics ranging from the
  historical to the deeply technical.
* Helping you set up a home recording studio on the cheap.
* Helping you learn to play folk songs on your guitar.  (If you want to learn
  to sing better, I can recommend an awesome voice teacher.)

Stories about the old days are free.
