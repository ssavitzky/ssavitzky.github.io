  NOTES:
    This page MUST NOT live in the same directory as the actual articles.
    Putting it there causes a recursion in post.excerpt.  It will,
    however, end up there in the build.

    Every article must have at least one tag.

    The following content really needs to go into a layout, or possibly an
    include.  It shares a lot with Blog as well, and the news feed on the home
    page.  Having an include that we can customize would prevent the
    proliferation of almost-identical layouts.
