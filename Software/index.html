<p> Selected code, either open source or written by me on my own time back in
    the days before "open source" was defined.

  </dt>
  <dd> A web server and templating engine for HTML and XML, with
       functional-programming semantics and XML syntax.  It makes a
       single pass through the input file, making it suitable for
       low-memory applications.  Ugly, but remarkably efficient.
       Originally written in Perl, rewritten in Java, partially
       rewritten to use the newly-defined DOM, and later ported to
       C.  Note that the earliest versions were roughly contemporary
       with the development of PHP, and predated both XML and the DOM.
    <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed the language and wrote the XML/HTML
       parser, the interpreter, and the DOM library.  This will also give
       you a good idea of how I like to organize a project, with
       HEADER.html files in most if not all directories.  (These are
       gradually being replaced with README.md as things get moved to
       GitHub.)  The HEADER.html files work really well if you're serving the
       project with Apache, with auto-indexing turned on.

  <dd> These are the tools I use to manage multiple websites, songbooks,
       recording projects, blogs, remote <code>git</code> repositories, and so
       on.  Also a good example of how I organize projects and use Makefiles
       as a way of aggregating commonly-used code snippets.

  <dd> I wrote this suite of programs for my late <a
       href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Savitzky"
       >father's</a> now-defunct consulting company.  They ran under
       MS-DOS, and provide a simple <code>mc</code>-like interface for
       transferring and converting files written by a variety of
       different Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometers and other devices.  The
       project involved writing drivers for several different
       filesystems, and used <code>make</code> for incremental backups
       and production as well as compilation.
