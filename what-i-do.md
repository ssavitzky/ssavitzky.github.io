"Curmudgeon" is usually defined as "[An ill-tempered (and frequently old)
person full of stubborn ideas or
opinions.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curmudgeon)".  A _computer_
curmudgeon, on the other hand, tends to be shy around people and old enough to
have learned that swearing at software rarely gets results.  Stubbornness,
however, usually does.

### Some of the things I can do for you:

Things <em>this</em> computer curmudgeon can do for you include:

* Teaching you how to use email, Slack, Signal, and Google to stay in touch
  with your grandkids (or your grandparents!)
* Helping you overcome a fear of computers.
* Showing you how to buy books online, and where to find thousand of free ones.
* Helping you set up a new computer, with awesome free software that runs on
  whatever operating system you like, and a desktop that works the way you
  expect it to.  I specialize in Linux, but I've been using -- and programming
  -- PCs since NS-DOS and CP/M, and Macs since the Mac II.
* Helping you install Linux, or repair a broken upgrade.
* Helping you set up regular backups, 
* Helping you set up your printer.
* Helping you set up a Raspberry Pi.
* Helping you set up your web browser to keep sites from tracking you.
* Helping you set up a website with WordPress, Weebly, or GitHub Pages, and
  teaching you to how add your own content.
* Teaching you how to use Linux.
* Helping you set up a blazing fast static website, and teaching you how to
  make changes on it instead of calling him for help.
* Teaching you how to manage the website that some other consultant left you with
  before they moved away.
* Helping you learn to program, in your choice of languages -- and helping you
  choose the right one.
* Getting your team started using `git` and GitHub.
* Explaining how `git` works and exactly why it's awesome.
* Automating common tasks with shell scripts.
* Talking to your group about the history of personal computers, the history
  of programming languages, (or any of a dozen other topics ranging from the
  historical to the deeply technical.
* Helping you set up a home recording studio on the cheap.
* Helping you learn to play folk songs on your guitar.  (If you want to learn
  to sing better, I can recommend an awesome voice teacher.)
