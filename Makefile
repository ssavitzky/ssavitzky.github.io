### If we're using the MakeStuff package, chain in its Makefile
#	This is optional -- it doesn't affect basic functionality -- but it
#	brings in a lot of useful extras like "make push", recursive "make all",
#	and so on.  Note that include does the right thing if the file list is
#	empty, so we don't have to test for that.
#
#	Normally Makefile is a symlink to Makestuff/Makefile, and
#	local dependencies go into depends.make.  We do it differently
#	here because we want 
#
CHAIN = $(wildcard ../MakeStuff/Makefile)
include $(CHAIN)

### report-vars
#	report-vars is also defined in the MakeStuff package, so you can use it to
#	see whether MakeStuff/Makefile is properly chained in.  It's also a very
#	handy way to see whether your make variables are defined properly.

	@echo CHAIN=$(CHAIN)
