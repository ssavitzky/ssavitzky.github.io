This is my GitHub Pages page.  I have more than one home page, for different
purposes; this one is specifically for my open-source software and
computer-related writing.  Up until recently I had planned to use it for my
[consulting business](https://computer-curmudgeon.com) as well, but I decided
to split them apart to keep both of them more focused.  The alert reader will
notice that the contact information is different for the two sites.

Almost all of the [Articles](/articles) posted on this site came from
someplace else.  Most -- except for a few old ones -- first appeared as blog
posts, either on my personal blog (on [Dreamwidth](https://dreamwidth.org/), an
excellent journaling community, under a different user id) or on
[computer-curmudgeon.com](https://computer-curmudgeon.com).  They have been
edited and updated for this site; if you're looking for something I've written
about computers or software, this is the place to look.

It is, of course, also the place to look for my [open-source
software](/Software/).  Some of those projects will eventually have GitHub
project pages

Blog posts on this site will generally be either site-related news (seen
below), or cross-posts related to the software here.
