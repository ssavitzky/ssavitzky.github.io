subtitle: Computer Curmudgeon for Hire

Sometimes you just need a curmudgeon -- the old guy who sits at the messy desk
in the corner with his laptop (a Thinkpad, of course) and his coffee, knows
the answer to almost every question, and is stubborn and patient enough to
_keep_ answering in six different ways until you understand it.  He has lots
of great stories about the way things were in the old days, but his browser
tabs have titles like "ReactJS", "Elm", "What's next for GitHub?", and "Linux
Weekly News".

A Computer Curmudgeon is someone who gets annoyed at your computer so you
don't have to.
