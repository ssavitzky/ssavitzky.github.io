title: About This Site

The design was inspired by [ HTML5-Up](https://html5up.net/)'s
[Read-Only](https://html5up.net/read-only).  Several attempts have been made
to make it into a Jekyll theme, but none of them worked the way I wanted them
to, so I started with [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), the default
theme, and used that as a base. The theme derived from this site will almost
certainly be called "Read-Mostly", when it's finished.

This site started out as a prototype for what eventually turned into
[computer-curmudgeon.com](https://computer-curmudgeon.com), the website for my
(incipient) freelance business.  It was also intended to replace my "resume"
site, [stephen.savitzky.net](https://stephen.savitzky.net/), but that turns
out to be better as it is; it's what I point recruiters and prospective
employers at, and makes a decent example of a site with minimal styling that
looks a lot like the printed version.

Site built {{site.time}} by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
{{site.github.versions.jekyll}} for GitHub Pages.
