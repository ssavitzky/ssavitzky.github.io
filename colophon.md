The theme of this site is an extremely hacked-up version of the default Jekyll
theme, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima); it is hoped that it will
eventually be turned into a theme in its own right.

The design was inspired by [Read-Only by
HTML5-Up](https://html5up.net/read-only).  Several attempts have been made to
make it into a Jekyll theme, but none of them worked the way I wanted them
to. The theme derived from this site will almost certainly be called
"Read-Mostly". 

Some time fairly soon it is expected that this site will replace my business
site at [Stephen.Savitzky.net](https://stephen.savitzky.net).  It is not yet
entirely clear where it will be hosted; that may depend on whether the golang
version of Jekyll is an adequate replacement.  For now, the new version is
hosted on GitHub and can be found at
[ssavitzky.github.io](https://ssavitzky.github.io/).

Site built {{ site.time }} by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for GitHub
Pages.
