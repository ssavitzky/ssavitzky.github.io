title: About This Site

The theme of this site is an extremely hacked-up version of the default Jekyll
theme, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima); it is hoped that it will
eventually be turned into a theme in its own right.

The design was inspired by [Read-Only, by
HTML5-Up](https://html5up.net/read-only).  Several attempts have been made to
make it into a Jekyll theme, but none of them worked the way I wanted them
to. The theme derived from this site will almost certainly be called
"Read-Mostly". 

This site started out as a prototype for what eventually turned into
[computer-curmudgeon.com](https://computer-curmudgeon.com), the website for my
(incipient) freelance business.  It was also intended to replace my "resume"
site, [stephen.savitzky.net](https://stephen.savitzky.net/), but that turns
out to be better as it is; it's what I point recruiters and prospective
employers at, and makes a decent example of a site with minimal styling that
looks a lot like the printed version.

Site built {{site.time}} by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
{{site.github.versions.jekyll}} for GitHub Pages.
